       <p>Here's where you're right now.</p>
       <br>
       You have a powerful message that you want to share with the world. <br>
      <br> You have a product or service that's succerssful for your customers results. <br>
      <br> But if your people are winning why aren't you winning to the scale you're supposed to be winning? <br>
      <br>What is stopping you from getting the entire world to know you? <br>
      <p>Your problem is not that your funnel isn't working, you have low conversation, your positioning is off, your copy sucks or that your service isn't valuable.</p>
      <p>Your problem is obscurity. Your problem is letting the world know you, your products and your services.</p>
      <h2>It's time to stop competing and dominate your market.</h2>
      <p>But first, I want to ask you a question.</p>
      <p> <br> When you think of enterpreneurship....Who's the first guy that comes to mind?(Gary Vee) <br>
        <br>When you think of sales...Who is the first guy that comes to mind?(Grant Cardone) <br>
    <br>When you think of personal development....Who's the first person that comes to mind?(Tony Robbins) <br> <br>And when you look up how to code, you won't get very far without coming across me. </p>
    <p>Look, you need to be in a place in your market where when someone has a need, you're the first and only person that should come to a potential customer's mind.</p>
    <p>Now the question is, how do you build that relationship with your audience where you are always the first person to come in their mind?</p>
    
     <p>I want to show you behind the scenes on how I've leveraged YouTube to build a business from scratch that has generated over $450,000 in less than 5 months.</p>
